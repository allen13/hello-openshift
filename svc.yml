# Types of Kubernetes services
# There are four types of Kubernetes services:

# 1. ClusterIP. This default type exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. You can reach the service only from within the cluster.
# 2. NodePort. This type of service exposes the service on each node’s IP at a static port. A ClusterIP service is created automatically, and the NodePort service will route to it. From outside the cluster, you can contact the NodePort service by using “<NodeIP>:<NodePort>”.
# 3. LoadBalancer. This service type exposes the service externally using the load balancer of your cloud provider. The external load balancer routes to your NodePort and ClusterIP services, which are created automatically.
# 4. ExternalName. This type maps the service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g., foo.bar.example.com). It does this by returning a value for the CNAME record.
